## Game Overview

**Shift at Midnight** plays like someone smashed together *Papers, Please*, *FNAF* and a co-op survival horror, then set the whole thing inside a lonely rural gas station in the 90s.

You’re working the **graveyard shift**. On paper, it’s simple:

- Serve customers  
- Check IDs  
- Keep the store stocked  
- Lock up at the end of your shift  

The problem?  

A portion of those “customers” are actually **doppelgangers**. If you let the wrong one through, the whole night spirals into chaos. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Gameplay naturally splits into three phases:

1. **Investigation Phase**  
   - Customers arrive one by one.  
   - You **check their ID**, **cross-check their details** on the computer, and **ask up to a limited number of questions**.  
   - Your job is to decide: **human or doppelganger?**

2. **Management Phase**  
   - Between waves, you’ll:
     - Restock shelves  
     - Manage deliveries  
     - Plan where to place traps  
     - Move around the station and prepare for trouble  
   - Think of it as a mini store management sim sandwiched inside a horror game.

3. **Survival Phase**  
   - If (when) things go bad, a creature gets loose.  
   - Suddenly, it’s all about **barricades, traps, and hiding spots**.  
   - You’ll listen for audio cues, watch the environment, and try to survive long enough to make it to dawn.

In the **demo**, the shifts are more scripted — you’ll get a curated taste of what the full game will be like. In the **full release**, runs are planned to be much more random, with an “enormous number of randomly generated shifts”, so every night can play out differently. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Whether you’re solo or playing co-op with up to two friends, your success depends on how well you can read people, manage time, and stay calm when things start scratching at the windows.

## Basic Controls & UI

Exact keybinds can change between versions, but the demo follows pretty standard PC horror controls. If something feels off, always double-check the in-game **Controls** menu.

### Movement & Interaction

- **Move** – `W / A / S / D`  
- **Look / Aim** – Mouse  
- **Interact / Talk / Use PC** – usually `E`  
- **Crouch** – `Ctrl`  
- **Sprint** – often `Shift` (if available in your build)  
- **Pause / Settings** – `Esc`

Treat this like any other first-person horror: move slowly, clear corners, and don’t spin your mouse like you’re in an FPS montage. You need to actually read things.

### The Front Desk UI

Most of your detective work happens at the **front counter**:

- **Customer Portrait** – their face and body language. Twitchy eyes, weird smiles, delayed reactions — all red flags.
- **Physical ID** – check:
  - Name  
  - Photo  
  - Expiry date  
  - Address / details
- **Computer Terminal** – lets you:
  - Cross-check ID data in the system  
  - Look up past records or watchlist tags  
  - Sometimes see extra notes about the customer

Think of it like airport security but with more blood.

### Question System

The signature mechanic: you only get **a limited number of questions per customer**. Once you burn through those, you have to make a call. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Questions might probe:

- Where they’re coming from / going  
- Details that should match the ID  
- Suspicious inconsistencies (job, address, previous visits)

Your goal is to squeeze the maximum info out of the **minimum number of questions**.

## First Night Walkthrough (Step-by-Step)

Let’s walk through a “typical” first night in the demo. Exact events can vary, but the rhythm is usually something like this:

### 1. Settling In

When you first gain control:

1. **Look around the station**  
   - Learn the layout: front counter, aisles, backroom, exits, windows.  
   - Find potential **choke points** and **hiding spots** early.

2. **Check the computer**  
   - Get familiar with:
     - Customer database  
     - Any tutorial messages / emails  
     - Basic UI navigation

3. **Adjust your settings** (we’ll talk more about this later):
   - Brightness  
   - Mouse sensitivity  
   - Subtitles

### 2. First Customers

Your early customers are basically a tutorial for the interrogation system:

1. **Greet them & grab the ID**  
2. **Compare the photo and the person**  
   - Do the eyes, haircut, age, and general vibe match?  
3. **Check the details on the ID**  
   - Expiry date  
   - Name spelling  
   - Address

4. **Use the computer to cross-check**  
   - Make sure the system data lines up with the physical ID.  
   - Any mismatch should raise your suspicion meter in your head, even if the game doesn’t show a literal bar.

5. **Ask 1–3 questions**  
   - Start with something simple:
     - “Where are you heading?”  
     - “How long have you lived at [address]?”  
   - Watch for hesitation, contradictions, or robotic answers.

At the end, you’ll be forced to decide: **approve or flag as doppelganger**.

Early on, the game is forgiving. Later customers will not be so chill.

### 3. Store Management Between Waves

When there’s a gap between customers:

- Walk the aisles and **check stock levels**.  
- Take note of:
  - Entrances you might want to barricade later  
  - Corners that would make decent hiding spots  
  - Narrow hallways where traps would be effective

If deliveries or new equipment show up, stash them somewhere you can access quickly once things escalate.

### 4. When Things Go Wrong

Eventually, you’ll hit the moment where a **wrong call**, a scripted event, or just bad luck means a creature gets loose.

At that point, the game flips into loud, panicked, “WHY IS IT BEHIND ME” mode:

1. **Drop whatever you’re doing**  
2. **Barricade priority doors and windows** (more on that next section)  
3. **Place traps** in likely paths  
4. **Listen**  
   - Footsteps, breathing, banging, or distorted voice lines can give away where the creature is.  
5. **Decide: hide or fight**  
   - In co-op, you might split roles (one baits, one supports, one secures routes).  
   - In solo, you’re playing both cat and mouse at the same time.

Survive the encounter, and you’re back to trying to run a “normal” gas station until the next nightmare starts.

## How to Question Customers Efficiently

You don’t have infinite time or infinite questions, so let’s talk actual tactics.

### 1. Always Start With the Basics

Before you ask anything, do a **silent check**:

- Does the **face** match the photo?  
- Does their **age** match what the ID claims?  
- Does the **expiration date** make sense?  
- Any super obvious typo or error?

If the ID already looks cursed, you know you need to dig deeper.

### 2. Use a 3-Layer Question Strategy

Think of your questions in three layers:

1. **Warm-up (1 question)**  
   - “Where are you headed?”  
   - “You been here before?”  
   - Purpose: get them talking, establish a baseline of how they sound when relaxed.

2. **ID-linked detail (1–2 questions)**  
   - Ask about:
     - Address  
     - Job  
     - Something specific on the ID  
   - Compare their answer with the written info.

3. **Pressure test (1 question)**  
   - Rephrase something they *already answered* in a slightly different way.  
   - Humans will usually stay consistent without thinking; fake things often break under repetition.

If a customer fails layer 2 or 3 badly, it’s usually safer to assume doppelganger.

### 3. Watch for Behavioral Red Flags

You’re not just reading text — you’re reading **people**:

- **Too calm** in a clearly creepy situation  
- **Delayed answers** to basic questions  
- **Overly specific** stories that feel rehearsed  
- Staring straight at you without blinking

One red flag is a coincidence. Three or more… maybe don’t let them walk around your store.

### 4. Don’t Waste Questions on Fluff

Avoid things like:

- “Nice weather, huh?”  
- “How’s your night going?”  

Unless the game explicitly uses small talk to reveal hidden tells, you should stick to questions that:

- Directly connect to the ID  
- Give you new, checkable information  
- Force them to improvise details

---

## Barricades & Traps

Once the game leaves “customer service” and enters “monsters in the vents”, barricades and traps become your best friends.

### 1. Pick Your Choke Points

Before anything happens, mentally mark:

- The **main door** customers enter through  
- Any **side doors or back exits**  
- Large windows that could be break-in points  
- **Narrow hallways** that would be perfect trap funnels

You don’t have infinite boards and equipment, so focus on:

- **Main entry points**  
- Paths that lead straight to you or your team  
- Areas with poor visibility

### 2. Smart Barricading

General rules:

- Don’t waste boards on doors you never use and the enemy rarely touches.  
- Barricade the **most direct paths** first.  
- Make sure you’re not barricading yourself into a dead end with no escape.

In co-op, assign one person as the **“defense lead”**:

- Their job is to remember where boards and traps are  
- They call out which door to reinforce next  
- Everyone feeds resources to them

### 3. Trap Placement Tips

Common trap mistakes:

- Dropping traps in the **middle of wide open rooms**  
- Clustering all traps in one place “just in case”  
- Forgetting which doorway you trapped and walking into it yourself

Try this instead:

- Place traps:
  - Just behind doors  
  - Around tight corners  
  - In narrow aisles between shelves  

- Think in pairs:
  - Trap + barricade  
  - Trap + hiding spot  

You want the creature to hit a trap **right before** it reaches you or a critical doorway.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

If your first few runs go horribly wrong, you’re not alone. Here’s a list of “don’t be that guy” moments.

1. **Ignoring the expiration date**  
   - Everything looks fine… except the ID expired five years ago. That’s not “oops”, that’s “shoot on sight”.

2. **Trusting vibes over evidence**  
   - “He just *seems* nice” is how horror movies start, not how they end well.

3. **Burning all your questions too fast**  
   - Don’t ask five random things in panic.  
   - Have a plan: warm-up → ID detail → pressure test.

4. **Tunnel-visioning on one system**  
   - Only staring at the PC and forgetting to watch the actual person.  
   - Or staring at the person and not checking the database.

5. **Bad time management**  
   - Spending ages on one customer and then getting overwhelmed later.  
   - Try to keep a rhythm: be thorough but decisive.

6. **Panicking when the creature appears**  
   - Running in circles, forgetting where your traps are, or hiding in a dead end.  
   - Breathe. Pick one plan: **barricade here**, **trap there**, **hide there**.

7. **Zero communication in co-op**  
   - Everyone doing their own thing silently is the fastest way to wipe.  
   - Call out suspicious details, announce where you’re placing traps, and warn before you barricade a door someone is using.

## Recommended Settings & Graphics

You don’t get bonus points for suffering through a game that’s too dark to see.

### 1. Video / Graphics

If your PC is mid-range or close to the **minimum specs** (roughly an Intel i3-2100, 4 GB RAM and a mid-tier GPU like a GTX 750 Ti), prioritize **frames and visibility** over ultra graphics. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Recommended tweaks:

- **Brightness / Gamma**
  - Set it so dark corners are spooky but not completely black.
- **Shadows**
  - Medium or Low if performance is bad.
- **Anti-Aliasing**
  - Low or off for extra FPS.
- **Resolution**
  - Native if possible; if you’re struggling, lower the resolution scale a bit instead of dropping the base resolution right away.

### 2. Audio

This game is heavily about **audio cues**:

- Turn **sound effects** fairly high.  
- Keep **music** a bit lower so you can hear footsteps, doors, and breathing.  
- Use **headphones** if at all possible — knowing whether a sound came from the left or right can save your life.

### 3. Controls & Accessibility

- **Mouse sensitivity** – Set something that lets you 180° turn quickly but still fine-tune on IDs and UI.  
- **Subtitles** – Turn them on. In horror, clear voice lines are important.  
- **Head bob / motion blur** – If you get dizzy easily, turn them down or off.

You’re now more prepared than most poor souls walking into **Shift at Midnight** blind.

Use your questions wisely, don’t cheap out on barricades, listen carefully, and remember: if a customer feels *just a little too normal* for this gas station… maybe that’s the most suspicious thing of all.
